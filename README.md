This is an implementation of Abdulaziz Ghuloum's paper, "An Incremental Approach to Compiler Construction".

I need to add more tests and refine the implementation a little bit but most of the features discussed in the paper are implemented here.

For now, I am more focused on another hoppy project I am actively working on: https://github.com/KareemErgawy/types-and-programming-languages
